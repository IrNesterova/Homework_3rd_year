-- function application. The space is sort of like an operator and it has the highest precedence.
-- Let's examine the type of max. It's max :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> a. That can also be written as max :: (Ord a) => a
-- -> (a -> a). That could be read as: max takes an a and returns (that's the ->) a function that takes an a and returns an a.
-- That's why the return type and the parameters of functions are all simply separated with arrows.
